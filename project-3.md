# Project: 3-Tier Serverless Architecture  

Goal  
Deploy a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient serverless 3-tier application using AWS services with a fully automated production setup.  

Tech Stack  
- Frontend: S3 + CloudFront  
- Backend: ECS (Fargate)  
- Database: Amazon RDS (MySQL)  
- Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager  
- Monitoring & Logging: CloudWatch  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions  

Architecture Overview  
query.konkas.tech → CloudFront → S3 (CORS Enabled) → ALB → ECS (Backend) → RDS  

Sprint 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)  

Epic: Terraform-Based AWS Infrastructure Setup  
1. Provision VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups  
2. Deploy an S3 bucket for frontend hosting with CloudFront integration  
3. Set up Application Load Balancer (ALB) for backend traffic  
4. Deploy an ECS Fargate service for backend APIs  
5. Provision an Amazon RDS (MySQL) database with:  
   - Multi-AZ setup  
   - Automated backups  
6. Configure Route 53 for domain-based access  
7. Implement AWS WAF for security  

Sprint 2: Application Deployment & CI/CD (Week 2-3)  

Epic: CI/CD Pipeline & Automated Deployments  
8. Set up GitHub Actions pipeline for CI/CD  
   - Build & push Docker images to Amazon ECR  
   - Deploy ECS services using Terraform  
   - Sync frontend assets to S3 & invalidate CloudFront cache  
9. Configure AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials & API keys  
10. Automate Blue/Green Deployment for zero downtime updates  

Sprint 3: Security & Monitoring (Week 3-4)  

Epic: Observability & Security Best Practices  
11. Enable CloudWatch Logs & Metrics for ECS and ALB  
12. Set up CloudWatch Alarms for ECS auto-scaling triggers  
13. Implement IAM best practices  
   - Least privilege access for ECS tasks  
   - Fine-grained control for RDS & Secrets Manager  
14. Enable AWS Shield Standard for DDoS protection  

Sprint 4: Scaling & Disaster Recovery (Week 4-5)  

Epic: High Availability & Performance Optimization  
15. Configure Auto Scaling for ECS services  
16. Enable Cross-Region RDS Read Replicas for disaster recovery  
17. Set up AWS Backup for RDS snapshots & ECS task backups  
18. Conduct failure simulation & load testing  

Outcome  
- Fully serverless, production-ready application  
- Cost-efficient, scalable, and secure setup  
- Automated deployments with GitHub Actions  
- Resilient architecture with disaster recovery strategies
