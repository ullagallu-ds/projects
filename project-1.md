  - ALB
  - CloudFront
  - WAF
  CRDS installation using Terraform
  - ALB Ingress Controller
  - External Secret Operator
  - External DNS Controller
- Scanning helm charts and terraform config files using trivy for vulenrabilities

- setup CI/CD pipelines to deploy app[DevSecOps]
  CI steps:
  - Declarative Checkout
  - Owasp Dependency Check
  - Docker build
  - Image Scanning
  - Image Push
  for CI -- using Jenkins CD Github Actions

- for secrets managment i'm using HashiCorp Vault
- Setup Montoring for CI/CD 
- Setup Montoring Using Prometheus and Grafana
- Setup Elastic Stack for Logging
- Istio



Goal:  
Deploy a microservices-based application across two AWS regions with automatic failover in case of a disaster.  

Tech Stack:  
- Terraform (for Infrastructure as Code)  
- AWS Global Accelerator (for traffic distribution)  
- Route 53 (for DNS failover)  
- ArgoCD (for GitOps-based deployment)  
- Velero (for backup & restore of Kubernetes resources)  
- Cross-Region RDS or DynamoDB Global Tables  
- FinOps (for cost optimization & efficiency monitoring)  

Sprint 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)  

Epic: Multi-Region EKS Cluster Deployment  
1. Setup VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups in both regions using Terraform  
2. Create IAM roles & policies for EKS clusters in both regions  
3. Provision two EKS clusters (one per region) using Terraform  
4. Configure kubectl to connect with both EKS clusters  
5. Set up AWS ALB Ingress Controller in both clusters  

Sprint 2: Database & Application Deployment (Week 2-3)  

Epic: Cross-Region Database & Microservices Deployment  
6. Deploy a MySQL (RDS) or DynamoDB Global Table with cross-region replication  
7. Set up Helm charts for microservices and deploy them on both clusters  
8. Configure Secrets & ConfigMaps for environment-specific values  
9. Implement Istio Service Mesh for traffic management between services  
10. Configure AWS CloudFront & WAF for security and global content delivery  

Sprint 3: Traffic Distribution & Failover Setup (Week 3-4)  

Epic: Global Traffic Management  
11. Configure Route 53 Latency-Based Routing between two EKS clusters  
12. Set up AWS Global Accelerator for intelligent traffic routing  
13. Implement health checks to detect cluster failures  
14. Test automatic failover by simulating a region failure  

Sprint 4: Backup, Monitoring & Logging (Week 4-5)  

Epic: Observability & Disaster Recovery  
15. Install and configure Velero for backing up Kubernetes resources  
16. Set up Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring both clusters  
17. Deploy ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging  
18. Implement log aggregation and centralized alerting for incident response  

Sprint 5: FinOps & Cost Optimization (Week 5-6)  

Epic: Cost Management & Optimization  
19. Implement AWS Cost Explorer & Budgets for real-time cost tracking  
20. Optimize EKS auto-scaling & right-sizing of instances for cost savings  
21. Analyze storage costs and implement lifecycle policies for S3 & RDS  
22. Use AWS Savings Plans & Reserved Instances for long-term cost reduction  
23. Generate FinOps reports and document cost-saving strategies  

Outcome:  
- High availability and disaster recovery across AWS regions  
- Automated failover in case of a cluster or region failure  
- Optimized cloud costs with proactive FinOps strategies  
- Fully automated deployment using Terraform and ArgoCD  

This version ensures resiliency while also focusing on cost efficiency, making it a well-balanced and production-ready project.
