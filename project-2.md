# Project: 3-Tier Microservices Application  

## Goal  
Deploy a highly available, scalable, and secure 3-tier microservices application using ECS with a fully automated production setup.  

## Tech Stack  
- AWS ECS (Fargate)  
- Terraform  
- AWS Secrets Manager  
- CloudFront & ALB  
- Amazon RDS (MySQL)  
- CloudWatch  
- GitHub Actions  

## Architecture Overview  
expense.konkas.tech → CloudFront → ALB → ECS (Frontend) → ECS (Backend) → RDS  

## Sprint 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)  

### Epic: Terraform-Based AWS Infrastructure Setup  
1. Create VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups for the application.  
2. Provision an ECS Cluster (Fargate) for frontend & backend.  
3. Set up Application Load Balancer (ALB) for frontend traffic.  
4. Deploy Amazon RDS (MySQL) with best practices:  
   - Multi-AZ deployment  
   - Automated backups & snapshots  
5. Configure CloudFront & Route 53 for domain-based access.  
6. Implement AWS WAF for security.  

## Sprint 2: Application Deployment & CI/CD (Week 2-3)  

### Epic: CI/CD Pipeline & Automated Deployments  
7. Set up GitHub Actions pipeline for CI/CD:  
   - Build & push Docker images to Amazon ECR  
   - Deploy ECS services using Terraform  
8. Configure AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials & API keys.  
9. Automate Blue/Green Deployment strategy for zero downtime updates.  

## Sprint 3: Security & Monitoring (Week 3-4)  

### Epic: Observability & Security Hardening  
10. Enable CloudWatch Logs & Metrics for ECS services.  
11. Configure CloudWatch Alarms for auto-scaling triggers.  
12. Set up AWS Config & GuardDuty for security compliance.  
13. Implement IAM best practices:  
   - Least privilege for ECS tasks  
   - Fine-grained access control for RDS & Secrets Manager  
14. Enable AWS Shield Standard for DDoS protection.  

## Sprint 4: Scaling, Backup & Disaster Recovery (Week 4-5)  

### Epic: High Availability & Disaster Recovery  
15. Implement Auto Scaling Policies for ECS services.  
16. Enable Cross-Region RDS Read Replicas for disaster recovery.  
17. Configure AWS Backup for RDS snapshots & ECS task backups.  
18. Conduct failure simulation & load testing.  

## Outcome  
- Production-ready, fully automated ECS deployment  
- Secure & scalable microservices architecture  
- Robust observability with CloudWatch logs & alerts  
- Disaster recovery mechanisms for high availability
